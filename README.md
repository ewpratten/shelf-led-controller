# LED controller for my bookshelf

This is the new source code for the LED controller I talked about in [this blog post](https://ewpratten.com/blog/shelf-lights/). 

In the time since writing that post, I've decided to replace the button-based control with a bit of Python code that allows my lights to be controlled via MQTT from Home Assistant.
